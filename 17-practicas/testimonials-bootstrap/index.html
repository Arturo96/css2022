                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                    learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                    people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
                    - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                    course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a
                    Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
